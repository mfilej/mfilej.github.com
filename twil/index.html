<p>
  In June of 2018 I started an experiment â€” writing a development journal. I
  have long been noticing that I often learn neat tricks, but never quite
  incorporate them in my workflow, so they end up being forgotten. In an
  attempt to better remember I started jotting these down in the journal. This
  site is a collection of such notes, grouped by week.

<ul class="twil-archive">
  {% for post in site.categories.twil %}
  <li>
    <a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
    {% for tag in post.tags %}
      <span>{{ tag }}</span>
    {% endfor %}
  </li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
