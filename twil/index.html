  In June of 2018, I started an experiment &mdash; writing a development
  journal &mdash; and this site is one of the byproducts. I have long been
  noticing how I learn neat tricks, but never entirely incorporate them into
  my workflow, so I end up forgetting them. To aid my memory, I started
  jotting these down in the journal. This site is a collection of such notes,
  grouped by week.

{% assign postsByYear = site.categories.twil | group_by_exp: "post", "post.date | date: '%Y'"  %}
{% for year in postsByYear %}
  <h2 class="twil-year">{{ year.name }}</h2>

  <ul class="twil-archive">
    {% for post in year.items %}
    <li>
      <a class="title" href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
      {{ post.summary | markdownify }}
      {% for tag in post.tags %}
        <span class="tag">{{ tag }}</span>
      {% endfor %}
    </li>
    {% endfor %}
  </ul>
{% endfor %}
