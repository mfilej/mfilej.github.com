  In June of 2018, I started an experiment â€” writing a development journal. I
  have long been noticing how I learn neat tricks, but never entirely
  incorporate them into my workflow, so I end up forgetting them. To aid my
  memory, I started jotting these down in the journal. This site is a
  collection of such notes, grouped by week.

{% assign postsByYear = site.categories.twil | group_by_exp: "post", "post.date | date: '%Y'"  %}
{% for year in postsByYear %}
  <h2>{{ year.name }}</h2>

  <ul class="twil-archive">
    {% for post in year.items %}
    <li>
      <a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
      {% for tag in post.tags %}
        <span>{{ tag }}</span>
      {% endfor %}
    </li>
    {% endfor %}
  </ul>
{% endfor %}
