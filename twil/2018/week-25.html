  <p>One could learn something new about the vast <a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive">vim-fugitive</a> every week and
still not run out of novelties for a long time. This week I took some time to
learn about the capabilities of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:Gstatus</code> command. Until now I’ve only
used it informatively, but from now on I will try to incorporate <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cvc</code>
(invokes <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git commit --verbose</code><sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>), <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cva</code> (same, but with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--amend</code>), and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ce</code> (amend without editing the commit message).</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">D</code> shows the diff for the selected file, and once the diff is open <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">zR</code>
expands all folds (vim folding being one of the areas that I also need to
explore at some point).</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">q</code> closes the status window – this one is not new, but a lot of the time I
still type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:q</code> out of habit.</p>

<p>As is always the case with vim-fugitive, there are many more things to
discover, but I want to internalize these mappings first.</p>
