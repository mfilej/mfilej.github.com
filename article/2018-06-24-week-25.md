One could learn something new about the vast [vim-fugitive][] every week and
still not run out of novelties for a long time. This week I took some time to
learn about the capabilities of the `:Gstatus` command. Until now I've only
used it informatively, but from now on I will try to incorporate `cvc`
(invokes `git commit --verbose`[^1]), `cva` (same, but with `--amend`), and
`ce` (amend without editing the commit message).

`D` shows the diff for the selected file, and once the diff is open `zR`
expands all folds (vim folding being one of the areas that I also need to
explore at some point).

`q` closes the status window â€“ this one is not new, but a lot of the time I
still type `:q` out of habit.

As is always the case with vim-fugitive, there are many more things to
discover, but I want to internalize these mappings first.

[^1]: Verbose is my preferred way of writing commits; fugitive's non-verbose alternative is `cc`.
