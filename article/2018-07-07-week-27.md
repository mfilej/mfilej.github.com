### `bundle add`

This week I stumbled upon the `bundle add` command. [Byebug's
README][byebug-readme] helpfully suggests to add the gem to the Gemfile by
running:

```
bundle add byebug --group "development, test"
```

I think it is a great use case for this command. Temporarily adding a debugger
is something I often need to do on projects that don't have one listed in the
Gemfile. It looks like in a future version of bundler we will also be able to
[remove gems][bundle-remove] via `bundle remove`. In this context, it is also
worth mentioning `bundle init`, which helps you start a new project with a
fresh Gemfile.

### Viewing WebSocket traffic with Charles

[Charles][] is an amazingly useful tool that has saved my bacon in many
different situations: regular proxying, reverse proxying, URL rewriting, DNS
spoofing ... This time I used it to view WebSocket traffic because it wasn't
showing up in the browser's inspector window for some reason. The easiest way
to find WebSockets from the list of connections is to enter `ws://` in the
_Filter_ text field (or look for connections with the 101 status code).
[Viewing web socket traffic with Charles][charles-ws] describes the process in
more detail.
