### fzf & fish

I've been using fzf from vim[^1] and in various custom scripts, but I've been putting off
installing [fish integration][fzf-fish] until now.

I'm trying to remember that `Ctrl-T` brings up a window that will fuzzy search
files recursively from the current directory.

`Alt-C` recursively searches directories and will `cd` you to the selected one.

## vim-fugitive

This week I learned [learned][gmerge-reddit] that calling `:Gmerge` during a
merge conflict loads the conflicted files from the current index into the
quickfix list. After that, it's [the usual][vim-unimpaired] `[n`, `]n` to jump across conflict
markers.
