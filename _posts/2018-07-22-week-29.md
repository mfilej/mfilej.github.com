### Amend last commit without changing the commit message

When I want to amend the last commit, the majority of the time it is because I forgot to add something, or more likely, I accidentally added a `# TODO` comment or a `debugger` line to the index. Until now, my workflow was to add the changes to the index and `git commit --amend -v` (using an [alias][]), which causes the editor to show up with the old commit message, and since there is no need to edit it, I would close the editor right away. Not horribly inefficient, but when I stumbled upon the `--no-edit` option, I knew it was something I needed to incorporate into my workflow.

`git commit --amend --no-edit` will amend the last commit, but instead of launching the editor, it will just keep the old commit message intact.
