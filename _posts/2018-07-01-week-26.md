This week I looked into [fish key bindings][fish-kb] again, and I found two
neat bindings I'd like to incorporate into my workflow.

## ⇧↹

Not unlike other shells, `Tab` completes the current token. `Shift-Tab` on the
other hand will complete the current token and **enter search mode**.

## ⌥F

When typing a command, Fish will offer suggestions based on entries in the
history. When the suggestion matches what you wanted to type, you can accept
it with `Ctrl-F` (`Ctrl-E also works`). It was probably the superpower that
won me over when I started using Fish. However, it took me until now to find
out its complement — `Alt-F` — which **accepts the first word** in the suggestion.

## ⌥L

`Alt-L` lists the contents of a directory — by default the current one, which compared to typing `ls` only saves one keystroke — unless the cursor is over a directory argument, in which case the contents of that directory will be listed.

## ⌥H
`Alt-H` shows the manual page for the current command while `Alt-P` appends `|less` to the end of the current command.

I'm not yet sure the last three will make it into my workflow, but I found them interesting nonetheless.
